# BrainTumorClassification
To detect and Classify the type of tumor with the help of brain MRI. 
This project successfully demonstrated the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automating brain tumor detection using MRI images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the developed model achieved a high level of accuracy, with training, validation, and test accuracies of 96%, 92%, and 93%, respectively. These results validate the model's robustness and its potential to support radiologists by providing accurate, consistent, and real-time tumor classifications.
The findings emphasize the importance of AI-driven diagnostic tools in reducing human error and improving the speed of diagnosis, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The proposed system serves as a foundational step toward integrating AI into clinical workflows, addressing challenges in medical imaging, and enhancing patient outcomes through early detection.
